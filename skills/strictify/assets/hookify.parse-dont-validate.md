Possible validate-then-discard pattern detected. The principle "parse, don't validate" means: coerce unstructured data into constrained types at the boundary of your system, so downstream code never needs to re-validate.

**Instead of validating and discarding the evidence:**
```python
def process(data: dict) -> None:
    if "user_id" not in data:
        raise ValueError("missing user_id")  # checked and discarded
```

**Parse into a constrained type that carries proof:**
```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class UserRequest:
    user_id: UserId
    # Construction IS validation. If it exists, it's valid.

def process(request: UserRequest) -> None:
    # No validation needed — the type proves it.
```

Use Pydantic models, frozen dataclasses, or `NewType` to carry proof through the type system. Parse at the boundary, execute with confidence downstream.

If this is internal code operating on already-parsed types, ignore this message.
